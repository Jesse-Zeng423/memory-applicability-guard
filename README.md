# Memory Applicability Guard

An open-source agent skill for reviewing whether a remembered fact should influence a current recommendation. It pairs concise agent instructions with a deterministic Python helper that checks explicit, structured inputs.

**Research-informed decision support only; not production validated.**

A memory can be relevant and true while still being outside the current task's scope, superseded by newer evidence, or unavailable under current permission. This skill makes those boundaries visible before an agent relies on the memory.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10 or later. No packages, model access, credentials, or network access are needed to run the helper and examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jesse-Zeng423/memory-applicability-guard.git
cd memory-applicability-guard
python3 -B examples/run_examples.py
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -B scripts/verify_release.py
```

The example runner checks full expected outputs for three synthetic cases: a superseded preference, explicit transfer into a new context, and an uncertain memory with a robust alternative. See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for individual commands.

## Install the skill

The installable folder is [`memory-applicability-guard/`](memory-applicability-guard/SKILL.md), not the repository root. Copy that entire folder into your agent's supported skill directory. Keep `scripts/`, `references/`, and `agents/` together with `SKILL.md`.

For a local Codex installation using its existing `~/.codex/skills` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
# First check that this destination does not already exist.
test ! -e ~/.codex/skills/memory-applicability-guard && cp -R memory-applicability-guard ~/.codex/skills/
```

If the destination already exists, review the installed version before replacing it. For another skill-capable agent, use its documented discovery directory. The helper is independent of any agent platform; automatic discovery depends on the host.

Example request:

> Use $memory-applicability-guard to audit the supplied candidate memory and proposed memory action. Use only the evidence in this request. Return the structured decision and its limitations.

Classify supplied evidence using [the classification rubric](memory-applicability-guard/references/classification-rubric.md). Provide the fields documented in [the decision model](memory-applicability-guard/references/decision-model.md). To run the helper directly:

```bash
python3 -B memory-applicability-guard/scripts/guard_decision.py < examples/superseded-preference.input.json
```

## Validation and compatibility

The helper validates input structure, then classification/evidence-kind
consistency. Unsupported `DIRECT`, `EXPLICIT_TRANSFER`, `SUPERSEDED`, or
`REVOKED` classifications are rejected; pending external verification cannot
coexist with decisive already-verified external evidence for the same claim.

Errors are JSON on stderr, with exit code 2 and no decision on stdout:
`INPUT_VALIDATION_ERROR` for invalid structure, or
`SEMANTIC_CONSISTENCY_ERROR` for inconsistent evidence-kind support.
Correct classifications using supplied evidence; never invent support to pass.
These checks do not verify evidence truth, recency, or actual entailment.

Medium-risk reliance requires decisive user or permission confirmation, and
conflicting evidence receives a distinct reason code. The stricter rejection
behavior changes the input acceptance contract; version 1.1.0 is adopted
for this update; the owner has approved that version. Publication through the hardening PR does not imply a merged release. The existing verdict format remains intact:
ASK_USER still describes the next step even when proposed reliance is ASK.

## How it works

```text
Current task + candidate memory + proposed reliance + supplied evidence
                              |
                    Agent classifies fields
                              |
                     JSON input validation
                              |
                  Deterministic precedence rules
                              |
               Structured decision for caller review
```

The output includes `guard_verdict`, `memory_action`, `memory_state`, `resolution_source`, `decisive_evidence`, `reason_code`, `next_step`, and `boundary`.

| Verdict | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS` | Proposed memory reliance matches the recommendation. |
| `REVISE` | Change the proposed memory reliance. |
| `ASK_USER` | Ask for missing, user-resolvable information. |
| `VERIFY_EXTERNAL` | Obtain current or third-party evidence before relying on memory. |
| `ESCALATE` | High-risk input requires qualified human review. |

`memory_action` is `USE`, `IGNORE`, or `ASK`. `PASS` never approves the underlying task. The helper cannot verify that an agent classified prose correctly; callers must support those classifications with evidence. Unknown fields should remain unknown.

## Research boundary

The frozen v0.7 experiment ended at `STOP_AT_V07`. A0 and M1 both scored 110/128, with matched net improvement of zero. Strict-twin stable flips were 28/40 for A0 and 27/40 for M1; ASK recall was 60% for both. These are historical research results, not measurements of this packaging update. See [research boundaries](memory-applicability-guard/references/research-boundaries.md).

Passing software tests establishes behavior on specified inputs. It does not show improved agent accuracy, reliable evidence extraction, or production safety. The helper does not retrieve memories, train or fine-tune a model, call an API, or execute recommended actions.

## Hacktoberfest 2026

This package is a portfolio deliverable and reusable open-source AI skill. Event participation requires a separate mapping to the published dashboard activities or challenge rules. Pull requests do not count toward rewards, per the [official FAQ](https://hacktoberfest.com/questions/). No challenge eligibility or reward is claimed. See [the event plan](docs/hacktoberfest-2026.md) before preparing an entry.

## Contributing and license

Add synthetic cases and tests for observed failures. Keep challenge-specific adapters separate from the core and run the checks above before proposing a change. After intentionally changing package files, regenerate integrity metadata with `python3 -B scripts/refresh_release.py`, then run verification again.
